## Transforming Data

### Verbs

Today we are going to cover a set of functions that take
a data frame as an input and return a new version of the
data frame. These functions are called *verbs* and come
from the **dplyr** package. If you are familiar with
running database queries, note that all of these verbs
map onto SQL commands. In fact, R can be set up so that
**dplyr** is called over a database rather than a local
data frame in memory.

There are over 30 verbs within **dplyr**, though most are
either a minor variant or a specific application of another
verb. Today we will see just five of them, which do the
following:

- select a subset of rows from the original dataset (`filter`)
- rearrange the rows of the input (`arrange`)
- pick a subset of the variable from the original (`select`)
- create new variables (`mutate`)
- collapse rows into a single summary (`summarize`)

In the case of all verbs, the first argument is the original
data frame and the output is a new data frame. It is important
to note that **verbs do not modify the original data**; they
operate on a copy of the original data.

To illustrate these verbs we will work with a dataset of
the every commercial flight that departed from New York City
in 2013.

```{r, message = FALSE}
flights <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/stat_data/flights.csv")
```

We will work with this data set all week as it is a great example
of the power of **dplyr**. Note that this dataset is not small;
if you did not follow my instructions in `setup.R` for how to stop
R from saving old datasets I suggest doing that now as your computer
will start having trouble with all of the old data copies we are
creating.

### Filtering rows

The filter function takes a dataset and returns a subset of the rows
of the original data. The first argument is the dataset and the
remaining arguments are logical statements that filter the data
frame. Only rows where the statements are true will be returned.

Let's grab only those flights that left after 11pm (2300):

```{r}
filter(flights, dep_time > 2300)
```

Notice that the result now has only 2,581 rows. However, the original
dataset has not been changed. If we want to test for whether a
variable is exactly equal to another value we use two equal signs
`==`. Here are all the flights that departed on Christmas Day:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11, day == 25)
```

If we want to do more with the data frame, we can save the results
as a new data frame:

```{r}
flights_dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 11, day == 25)
```

In order to filter flights that took off between noon (1200) and
3pm (1500), that is easy with two logical statements (notice the
`>=` and `<=` for greater then and equal to and less than or
equal to):

```{r}
filter(flights, dep_time >= 1200, dep_time <= 1500)
```

How might we get flights that left between 11pm and 4am? Here
we need to say that either one of two conditions are true: the
flight left after 11pm OR before 4am. To encode this we use
a vertical bar `|` to stand in for the statement OR:

```{r}
filter(flights, dep_time >= 2300 | dep_time <= 400)
```

Pay close attention to the syntax as a lot of students at first
want to map directly from English into R with:

```{r}
dep_time >= 2300 | <= 400
```

But this will throw an error message. Finally, you may want to
check whether a variable is in a fixed set of values (most often
this occurs with a categorical variable). To do this we use the
operator `%in%`. For example, here we select only those rows that
correspond to flights to Boston (BOS), Providence (PVD), or
Manchester, New Hampshire (MHT):

```{r}
filter(flights, dest %in% c("BOS", "PVD", "MHT"))
```

### Arranging rows

Next, we will see how to reorder to rows in a data frame using the
`arrange` function. Like all verbs it takes the data frame as its
first argument. Other arguments specify which variables to sort by:

```{r}
arrange(flights, dep_time)
```

Other variables break ties in earlier variables:

```{r}
arrange(flights, dep_time, arr_time)
```

To sort a variable in reverse order, wrap it in the `desc` function:

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_time), arr_time)
```

### Selecting columns

With larger datasets (or when producing reports) it is sometimes
useful to select just a subset of the columns in the original
dataset. To do this, we use the `select` function. The first input
is the data set, with other arguments being variables we want to
look at:

```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, origin, dest)
```

I will now use this throughout our class notes so that you may
more clearly see what is going on without the variables of interest
(which tend to be on the end as we add them) being hidden.

### Adding and modifying variables

The `mutate` function creates new variable in our dataset as a
function of other variables already present in the data. The
function always add variables at the end of the dataset, so in
order to see the results we will work with a smaller subset:

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, year, month, day, arr_delay,
                      dep_delay, distance, air_time)
```

Lets calculate the average speed of the flight. The mutate function
takes the data frame as its first argument followed by named arguments
describing the new variables:

```{r}
mutate(flights_sml, speed = distance / air_time * 60)
```

Similarly, we can figure out how much time was lost or gained
between the departure delay and arrival delay:

```{r}
mutate(flights_sml, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay)
```

Note that you can overwrite variables that already exist with mutate
as well, though in general this should be avoided.

### Summarizing data

The `summarize` function collapses a data frame into a single row
summary. We need to specify exactly what summaries are performed.
Here, we will grab the mean values for arrival and departure delays:

```{r}
summarize(flights, avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
                   avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay))
```

There is also a special function called `n()` that summarizes the
total number of rows:

```{r}
summarize(flights, avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
                   avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
                   n = n())
```

Other summary functions that you might find useful:

- `min`
- `max`
- `median`
- `sd` - standard deviation
- `quantile(x, 0.25)` - generalization of median; here, a value
that is greater than 25% of the data
- `first`, `last`, `nth`

Summarizing datasets does not seem particularly useful here as
we have other ways of computing the means and counts of a dataset
without using a new function. The real power of the summary
function comes when we learn how to group datasets next class.

## Pipes

The pipe operator `%>%` is a relative newcomer within the R
ecosystem. It is incredibly useful for writing readable code
with **dplyr** and ggplot2. The pipe passes the output of
one function to the first argument of the next function. Because
`ggplot` and all of the dplyr verbs take a data frame as its
first input we can pipe together a number of operations without
saving the intermediate results.

For example, lets see the average change in delay between departure
and arrival for flights leaving from JFK:

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay) %>%
  ggplot(aes(gain)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

We can also save the results of a long piped set of commands as
a new dataset:

```{r}
flights_best_gain_jfk <- flights %>%
  filter(origin == "JFK") %>%
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay) %>%
  filter(gain > 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(gain)) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, dest, gain)
flights_best_gain_jfk
```

Notice the standard syntax of the piped commands: each line after
the first is indented and we usually pipe the data itself as the
first line. With a **ggplot2** command, subsequent rows are indented
twice.
